## About
pl701 is just an exprimental language based on [SECD machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECD_machine/).
Currently the impelmentation follows very closely to Peter Henderson's [Lispkit Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lispkit_Lisp).
I don't know what kind of language I want it to be. In fact, I have no idea what I am doing...
